				                  living in a range of environments. The colloquial, diaristic
						                style conceals the workings of a startlingly original
								              experimental mind. Later scientists could not match the
									                    resolution and clarity of Leeuwenhoek's microscopes, so his
											                  discoveries were doubted or even dismissed over the following
													                centuries, limiting their direct influence on the history of
															              biology; but work in the twentieth century confirmed
																                    Leeuwenhoek's discovery of bacterial cells, with a resolution of
																		                  less than 1 Âµm. Leeuwenhoek delighted most in the forms,
			                  interactions and behaviour of his little 'animalcules', which
						                inhabited a previously unimagined microcosmos. In these
								              reflections on the scientific reach of Leeuwenhoek's ideas and
									                    observations, I equate his questions with the preoccupations of
											                  our genomic era: what is the nature of Leeuwenhoek's animalcules,
					                where do they come from, how do they relate to each other? Even
								              with the powerful tools of modern biology, the answers are far
									                    from resolved-these questions still challenge our understanding
											                  of microbial evolution. This commentary was written to celebrate

  abstract = "Global deserts occupy one-third of the Earth's surface and
              contribute significantly to organic carbon storage, a process at
              risk in dryland ecosystems that are highly vulnerable to
              climate-driven ecosystem degradation. The forces controlling
              desert ecosystem degradation rates are poorly understood,
              particularly with respect to the relevance of the arid-soil
              microbiome. Here we document correlations between increasing
              aridity and soil bacterial and archaeal microbiome composition
              along arid to hyperarid transects traversing the Atacama Desert,
              Chile. A meta-analysis reveals that Atacama soil microbiomes
              exhibit a gradient in composition, are distinct from a broad
              cross-section of nondesert soils, and yet are similar to three
              deserts from different continents. Community richness and
              diversity were significantly positively correlated with soil
              relative humidity (SoilRH). Phylogenetic composition was strongly
              correlated with SoilRH, temperature, and electrical conductivity.
              The strongest and most significant correlations between SoilRH
              and phylum relative abundance were observed for Acidobacteria,
              Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, and
              Euryarchaeota (Spearman's rank correlation [rs] = >0.81;
              false-discovery rate [q] = $\leq$0.005), characterized by 10- to
              300-fold decreases in the relative abundance of each taxon. In
              addition, network analysis revealed a deterioration in the
              density of significant associations between taxa along the arid
              to hyperarid gradient, a pattern that may compromise the
              resilience of hyperarid communities because they lack properties
              associated with communities that are more integrated. In summary,
              results suggest that arid-soil microbiome stability is sensitive
              to aridity as demonstrated by decreased community connectivity
              associated with the transition from the arid class to the
              hyperarid class and the significant correlations observed between
              soilRH and both diversity and the relative abundances of key
              microbial phyla typically dominant in global soils. IMPORTANCE We
              identify key environmental and geochemical factors that shape the
              arid soil microbiome along aridity and vegetation gradients
              spanning over 300 km of the Atacama Desert, Chile. Decreasing
              average soil relative humidity and increasing temperature explain
              significant reductions in the diversity and connectivity of these
              desert soil microbial communities and lead to significant
              reductions in the abundance of key taxa typically associated with
              fertile soils. This finding is important because it suggests that
              predicted climate change-driven increases in aridity may
              compromise the capacity of the arid-soil microbiome to sustain
              necessary nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration functions as
              well as vegetative cover in desert ecosystems, which comprise
              one-third of the terrestrial biomes on Earth.",

              Sample Identifiers for Comparative Omics Studies",

              J Gregory",
  abstract = "The number of samples in high-throughput comparative ``omics''
              studies is increasing rapidly due to declining experimental
              costs. To keep sample data and metadata manageable and to ensure
              the integrity of scientific results as the scale of these
              projects continues to increase, it is essential that we
              transition to better-designed sample identifiers. Ideally, sample
              identifiers should be globally unique across projects, project
              teams, and institutions; short (to facilitate manual
              transcription); correctable with respect to common types of
              transcription errors; opaque, meaning that they do not contain
              information about the samples; and compatible with existing
              standards. We present cual-id, a lightweight command line tool
              that creates, or mints, sample identifiers that meet these
              criteria without reliance on centralized infrastructure. cual-id
              allows users to assign universally unique identifiers, or UUIDs,
              that are globally unique to their samples. UUIDs are too long to
              be conveniently written on sampling materials, such as swabs or
              microcentrifuge tubes, however, so cual-id additionally generates
              human-friendly 4- to 12-character identifiers that map to their
              UUIDs and are unique within a project. By convention, we use
              ``cual-id'' to refer to the software, ``CualID'' to refer to the
              short, human-friendly identifiers, and ``UUID'' to refer to the
              globally unique identifiers. CualIDs are used by humans when they
              manually write or enter identifiers, while the longer UUIDs are
              used by computers to unambiguously reference a sample. Finally,
              cual-id optionally generates printable label sticker sheets
              containing Code 128 bar codes and CualIDs for labeling of sample
              collection and processing materials. IMPORTANCE The adoption of
              identifiers that are globally unique, correctable, and easily
              handwritten or manually entered into a computer will be a major
              step forward for sample tracking in comparative omics studies. As
              the fields transition to more-centralized sample management, for
              example, across labs within an institution, across projects
              funded under a common program, or in systems designed to
              facilitate meta- and/or integrated analysis, sample identifiers
              generated with cual-id will not need to change; thus, costly and
              error-prone updating of data and metadata identifiers will be
              avoided. Further, using cual-id will ensure that transcription
              errors in sample identifiers do not require the discarding of
              otherwise-useful samples that may have been expensive to obtain.
              Finally, cual-id is simple to install and use and is free for all
              use. No centralized infrastructure is required to ensure global
              uniqueness, so it is feasible for any lab to get started using
              these identifiers within their existing infrastructure.",

              require placing conservation priorities on different taxa. A
              system of priorities that reflects the value of taxonomic
              diversity can be achieved by setting priorities such that the
              subset of taxa that is protected has maximum underlying feature
              diversity. Such feature diversity of taxon subsets is difficult
              to estimate directly, but can be predicted by the
              cladistic/phylogenetic relationships among the taxa. In this
              study, a simple measure of phylogenetic diversity is defined
              based on cladistic information. The measure of phylogenetic
              diversity, PD, is contrasted with a measure of taxic diversity
              recently developed by Vane-Wright et al. (Biol. Conserv., 55,
              1991). In re-examining reserve-selection scenarios based on a
              phylogeny of bumble bees (Apidae), PD produces quite different
              priorities for species conservation, relative to taxic diversity.
              The potential application of PD at levels below that of the
              species is then illustrated using a mtDNA phylogeny for
              populations of crested newts Triturus cristatus. Calculation of

  abstract = "We introduce here a new method for computing differences between
              microbial communities based on phylogenetic information. This
              method, UniFrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets
              of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch
              length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one
              environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to
              determine whether communities are significantly different, to
              compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and
              ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions
              of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to
              similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of
              UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from
              cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine
              sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured
              isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and
              environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental
              clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical
              location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community
              differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic and Antarctic;
              and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially
              impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm
              oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater
              samples are not more similar to each other than to those in
              sediment or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac
              provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using
              the wealth of environmental rRNA sequences, and allows
              quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the

  abstract  = "The purpose of model selection algorithms such as All Subsets,
               Forward Selection and Backward Elimination is to choose a linear
               model on the basis of the same set of data to which the model
               will be applied. Typically we have available a large collection
               of possible covariates from which we hope to select a
               parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response
               variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection
               algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional
               forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived:
               (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the
               Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that
               constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the
               LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a
               given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time
               than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification
               efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression,
               another promising new model selection method; this connection
               explains the similar numerical results previously observed for
               the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties
               of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the
               simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the
               degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which
               we derive a Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a
               principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates.
               LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper
               describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the
               same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary
               least squares applied to the full set of covariates.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: As microbial ecologists take advantage of
              high-throughput sequencing technologies to describe microbial
              communities across ever-increasing numbers of samples, new
              analysis tools are required to relate the distribution of
              microbes among larger numbers of communities, and to use
              increasingly rich and standards-compliant metadata to understand
              the biological factors driving these relationships. In
              particular, the Earth Microbiome Project drives these needs by
              profiling the genomic content of tens of thousands of samples
              across multiple environment types. FINDINGS: Features of EMPeror
              include: ability to visualize gradients and categorical data,
              visualize different principal coordinates axes, present the data
              in the form of parallel coordinates, show taxa as well as
              environmental samples, dynamically adjust the size and
              transparency of the spheres representing the communities on a
              per-category basis, dynamically scale the axes according to the
              fraction of variance each explains, show, hide or recolor points
              according to arbitrary metadata including that compliant with the
              MIxS family of standards developed by the Genomic Standards
              Consortium, display jackknifed-resampled data to assess
              statistical confidence in clustering, perform coordinate
              comparisons (useful for procrustes analysis plots), and greatly
              reduce loading times and overall memory footprint compared with
              existing approaches. Additionally, ease of sharing, given
              EMPeror's small output file size, enables agile collaboration by
              allowing users to embed these visualizations via emails or web
              pages without the need for extra plugins. CONCLUSIONS: Here we
              present EMPeror, an open source and web browser enabled tool with
              a versatile command line interface that allows researchers to
              perform rapid exploratory investigations of 3D visualizations of
              microbial community data, such as the widely used principal
              coordinates plots. EMPeror includes a rich set of controllers to
              modify features as a function of the metadata. By being
              specifically tailored to the requirements of microbial
              ecologists, EMPeror thus increases the speed with which insight
              can be gained from large microbiome datasets.",
